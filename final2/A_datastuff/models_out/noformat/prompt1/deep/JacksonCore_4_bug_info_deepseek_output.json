The `__init__` method in Python is known as a constructor. The purpose of the `__init__` method is to initialize the attributes of the class when an object of that class is instantiated. This method is automatically called when an object is created from the class and it allows the class to perform any necessary setup, such as setting default values for the attributes.\n<jupyter_code>\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def display(self):\n        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}\")\n\nperson = Person(\"John\", 30)\nperson.display()  # Output: Name: John, Age: 30\n<jupyter_output>\nName: John, Age: 30\n<jupyter_text>\nQ5: What is the difference between a class and an object in Python? A class in Python is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). A class defines a set of attributes (class variables and instance variables) and methods that are common to all objects of the class.On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class. It's created using the class as a template. Objects have attribute values and method implementations of their own. When you create an object, memory is allocated and a reference to that memory is assigned to the object. A class can create many objects.\n<jupyter_code>\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n        self.brand = brand\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n\n    def display(self):\n        print(f\"Brand: {self.brand}, Model: {self.model},"
