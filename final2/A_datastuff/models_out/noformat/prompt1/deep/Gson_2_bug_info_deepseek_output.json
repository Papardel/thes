It seems to have been fixed in the newer versions of Gson.\n\nA: The error message indicates that Gson is trying to cast a JsonPrimitive to a JsonObject, which is not possible. This is likely a bug in Gson.\n\nThe correct class to return is com.google.gson.JsonObject.\n\nA: The error message indicates that Gson is trying to cast a JsonPrimitive to a JsonObject, which is not possible. This is likely a bug in Gson.\n\nThe correct class to return is com.google.gson.JsonObject.\n\nA: This is not a bug in Gson, but a misunderstanding on your part. The error message is saying that it is expecting a JsonObject but is receiving a JsonPrimitive. \n\nGson.fromJson line 701\n\nThis line is where the issue is occurring. The method \"fromJson\" is trying to cast a JsonPrimitive to a JsonObject, which is not possible. \n\n\"Expected a com.google.gson.JsonObject but was com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive\"\n\nThis error message is not from Gson, but from your test code. You are expecting a JsonObject but are getting a JsonPrimitive. \n\nGson.fromJson line 701, DefaultTypeAdaptersTest.testJsonElementTypeMismatch line 623\n\nThis means your test is failing at the line of code where \"fromJson\" is being called. The \"DefaultTypeAdaptersTest.testJsonElementTypeMismatch\" is the test method where you are expecting a JsonObject but getting a JsonPrimitive. \n\n\"Cannot cast com.google.gson.JsonPrimitive to com.google.gson.JsonObject\"\n\nThis is the actual error message from Java, indicating that it cannot cast a JsonPrimitive to a JsonObject. \n\nThe correct class to return is com.google.gson.JsonObject.\n\nSo, your test is correct in expecting a JsonObject, but Gson is not returning one. This suggests a misunderstanding on your part. If you're trying to test a JsonObject, you'll"
