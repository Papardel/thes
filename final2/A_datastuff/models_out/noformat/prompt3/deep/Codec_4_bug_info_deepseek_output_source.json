      "response": "RESPONSE: org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64.public Base64(boolean urlSafe)\n```java\npublic Base64(boolean urlSafe) {\n        this(CHUNK_SIZE, CHUNK_SEPARATOR, urlSafe);\n    }\n```\nThis is the method that most likely causes the bug. The constructor for the Base64 class is taking a boolean parameter, urlSafe, and passing it to another constructor in the same class. However, there's no other constructor defined in the Base64 class that takes three parameters. As a result, this constructor will always have its default value (false), and the urlSafe parameter will be ignored. This could lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided information and may not be 100% accurate. In some cases, the bug might not be in the constructor but in the methods that use it.\n\nAlso, the provided methods are not enough to determine the bug. We need more information about the bug, such as the symptoms, the stack trace, or the expected behavior that doesn't occur.\n\nFinally, the bug might not be in the constructor but in the methods that use it. You need to review the methods that use the Base64 class to ensure that the parameters are being used correctly."
