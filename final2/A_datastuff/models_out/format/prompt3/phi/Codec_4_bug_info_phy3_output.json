      "response": "RESPONSE:\n\nRESPONSE: <method_id>\n\n---\n\nGiven the methods provided, without additional context or information about the bug, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug solely based on the signatures and the code snippets. However, we can analyze each method for potential issues that might lead to a bug:\n\n### Method 1: Base64 Initialization\nThis method initializes a new Base64 object without any specific configuration. It could potentially lead to a bug if the default settings do not align with the requirements of the application, such as URL-safe encoding not being enabled by default.\n\n### Method 2: URL-Safe Base64 Encoding\nThis method explicitly encodes data in a URL-safe Base64 format, which replaces '+' with '-' and '/' with '_'. If the application requires standard Base64 encoding without URL-safety, this method could cause issues by altering the encoded data in an unexpected way.\n\n### Method 3: Chunked Base64 Encoding\nThis method encodes data in chunks, which might be useful for streaming large amounts of data. However, if the chunk size or separator is not properly configured, or if the method is used in an environment that does not support chunked encoding, it could lead to incomplete or corrupted Base64 data.\n\n### Method 4: Custom Base64 Initialization\nThis method allows for customization of the Base64 object by specifying a line length and a line separator. Incorrect settings here could result in malformed Base64 encoded data, especially if the line length exceeds the maximum line length supported by the Base64 algorithm (which is 76 characters) or if an invalid line separator is used.\n\n### Method 5: Calculating Encoded Length\nThis private method calculates the length of the encoded data based on the input array's length, the chunk size, and the chunk separator. It's possible that this method could contribute to the bug if it returns an incorrect length, leading to buffer overflows or insufficient memory allocation when storing the encoded data.\n\nGiven the information, **Method 3: encodeBase64Chunked(byte[] binaryData)** seems to be the most likely candidate to cause the bug, especially if"
