Your task is to analyze the codebase and identify the most suspicious method signatures. \n\nIMPORTANT: You must reply _exactly_ in this form: \nRESPONSE:\n<signature-1>\n<signature-2>\n<signature-3>\n<signature-4>\n<signature-5>\n```\n\n## Response\n```\n<signature-1>\npublic VerificationOverTimeImpl(long pollingPeriodMillis, long durationMillis, VerificationMode delegate, boolean returnOnSuccess)\n\n<signature-2>\npublic VerificationOverTimeImpl(long pollingPeriodMillis, long durationMillis, VerificationMode delegate, boolean returnOnSuccess, Timer timer)\n\n<signature-3>\npublic void verify(VerificationData data)\n\n<signature-4>\npublic AssertionError handleVerifyException(AssertionError e)\n\n<signature-5>\npublic boolean canRecoverFromFailure(VerificationMode verificationMode)\n```\n```\n\nThese signatures appear to be suspicious due to their usage in the context of mockito's verification. The first two appear to be constructors, which could be used to create instances of the VerificationOverTimeImpl class. The next three methods, however, are not constructors, and they seem to be part of the public API of the VerificationOverTimeImpl class.\n\nThe first two could be used to create instances of the VerificationOverTimeImpl class with different parameters, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. The next three methods, however, are part of the public API of the VerificationOverTimeImpl class and they appear to be used in the context of mockito's verification, which is typically used in unit testing. Therefore, they are not considered suspicious.\n\nPlease note that the actual signatures might differ based on the actual codebase and the context of the code. The provided signatures are based on the provided code snippet and might not represent the actual signatures in the codebase."
