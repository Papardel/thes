      "response": "signatures from the candidate source classes and their method signatures (modifiers removed) that may not follow the standard Mockito API design principles.\n\nFor each method (or constructor) signature you list, write a brief explanation of why you consider it suspicious and how it might violate Mockito's API design principles.\n\nUse this format:\n1. Signature:\n   - Explanation:\n\n2. Signature:\n   - Explanation:\n\n...\n\nEnsure that each explanation includes the potential impact on Mockito's API design principles.\n\n# Response:1. Signature:\n   - `private final long pollingPeriodMillis;`\n   - Explanation:\n     This field is private and final, which means it is not accessible or modifiable by the user of the class, which goes against the principle of encapsulation in Mockito's API design. This design choice could prevent users from customizing the polling period for `VerificationOverTimeImpl`, which is an essential feature for mock verification timing.\n\n2. Signature:\n   - `private final long durationMillis;`\n   - Explanation:\n     Similar to the `pollingPeriodMillis`, the `durationMillis` field is private and final, making it inaccessible to the users of the class. This restriction could limit the ability of users to specify the duration for the verification process, which is a critical aspect of Mockito's verification features.\n\n3. Signature:\n   - `private final Timer timer;`\n   - Explanation:\n     The `timer` field is private and not exposed to the users of the class. This design choice prevents users from having direct control over the timing mechanism used by Mockito's verification process. This could impact the flexibility and customization options available to users when dealing with mock verification timeouts.\n\n4. Signature:\n   - `void verify(VerificationData data)`\n   - Explanation:\n     This method signature is suspicious because it does not specify any access modifiers (e.g., public, protected). In Mockito's API design, public methods are encouraged to ensure maximum accessibility and usability. A private method like this could limit the usage of the `VerificationOverTimeImpl` class, hindering the flexibility and extensibility of"
