The issue at hand involves a bug that arises when attempting to perform a series of operations that may involve precision loss or incorrect handling of special values, such as zero or infinity.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n1. The bug manifests when performing division by zero or very large numbers.\n2. The bug may also occur when comparing two BigFraction instances with different denominators.\n3. The bug should not be related to arithmetic operations that result in a finite number of trailing zeros in the numerator or denominator.\n4. The bug should not involve operations that are deterministic and guaranteed to produce the same result (e.g., multiplying by one).\n5. The bug must be identified within the context of the BigFraction class and its public methods.\n6. The bug should not be a known limitation or documented issue in the library's documentation.\n7. The bug must involve a method call that is not a constructor.\n8. The bug must be consistent across different runtime environments and platforms.\n\nGiven the following methods from the Apache Commons Math library, analyze them and pinpoint the one that is most likely to be the source of the bug:\n\n### Method 1\nSignature: org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.BigFraction.public BigFraction add(final BigFraction object)\n```java\npublic BigFraction add(final BigFraction object) {\n    BigInteger n1 = numerator.multiply(object.denominator);\n    BigInteger d1 = denominator.multiply(object.numerator);\n    BigInteger n2 = object.numerator.multiply(denominator);\n    BigInteger d2 = object.denominator.multiply(this.denominator);\n    return new BigFraction(n1.add(n2), d1.add(d"
