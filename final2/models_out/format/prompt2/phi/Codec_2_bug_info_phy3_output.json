You MUST choose the five methods that are MOST likely to cause the exception.

You must now identify which methods could potentially be at fault for causing the exception. However, you must only consider methods that deal with data processing, specifically those that handle input/output operations. Additionally, you must exclude methods that are utility functions, such as those that determine if a byte is base64 or perform simple checks. Your selections must also disregard methods that are not directly involved in the encoding or decoding process but are preparatory steps, such as those that resize buffers or discard whitespace. Moreover, you must exclude methods that are solely for handling exceptions or error reporting. Your list should reflect the methods that are actively involved in the transformation of data from one form to another within the context of Base64 encoding/decoding. Your selections must be limited to those methods that handle the actual conversion process. You must explain your reasoning for each method's inclusion, focusing on how they contribute to the potential failure of the test case.\n\nResponse:RESPONSE:\n<encodeBase64>\n<decodeBase64>\n<encodeBase64URLSafe>\n<encodeBase64Chunked>\n<encode>\n\nREASONING:\n- <encodeBase64> is directly involved in the encoding process, converting binary data into Base64. If there is an issue with the input binary data or the encoding process itself, this method could be at fault.\n- <decodeBase64> is responsible for the decoding process, converting Base64 encoded data back into binary. Errors in decoding could be due to incorrect or incomplete Base64 input.\n- <encodeBase64URLSafe> performs encoding with URL-safe rules, which could introduce additional constraints or errors not present in standard Base64 encoding.\n- <"
