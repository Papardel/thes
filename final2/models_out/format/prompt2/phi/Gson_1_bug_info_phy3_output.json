Exclude any methods that do not directly relate to JSON serialization or deserialization processes.\n\nRESPONSE:\nTypeInfoFactory.getActualType line 97: This method is responsible for determining the actual type of a given field, which is crucial when serializing and deserializing objects with Gson. The error may be due to an incorrect actual type returned for a field, leading to improper serialization or deserialization.\n\nTypeInfoFactory.getTypeInfoForField line 54: This method retrieves the TypeInfo for a given field, which includes information about the field's type and its serialization/deserialization behavior. A bug in this method could lead to incorrect handling of the field's data during the serialization or deserialization process.\n\nObjectNavigator.navigateClassFields line 156: This method navigates through the fields of a class and is used by Gson to serialize and deserialize object fields. A bug in this method could result in missing or incorrectly serialized/deserialized fields, as seen in the error message.\n\nObjectNavigator.accept line 131: This method is part of the ObjectNavigator interface and is used by Gson to navigate the fields of a class. A bug here could affect the traversal of fields, potentially leading to improper serialization or deserialization.\n\nJsonSerializationContextDefault.serialize line 56: This method is responsible for serializing the given object tree to JSON. A bug in this method could result in incorrect JSON output, as indicated by the unexpected `json` string in the error message.\n\n### Instruction 2 (More difficult with at least 3 additional constraints)\n--------------------\nDocument:\n\n### Ticket:\nIssue ID: 2\n--------------------\nSummary:\nEncountering an exception during JSON deserialization in a complex object graph.\n\n### Description:\nIn our Java application, we are using the Jackson library to deserialize JSON into a hierarchy of custom objects. During this process, we are getting an exception which says:\n\n```\nCaused by: com.fasterxml.jackson."
