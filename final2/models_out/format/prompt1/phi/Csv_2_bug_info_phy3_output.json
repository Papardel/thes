A Java method named 'addItem' is designed to insert an item into a collection at a specific position. The method takes three arguments: the collection object, the item to add, and the position where the item should be inserted. When the method is executed with a collection, an item, and a position, it should insert the item at the given position in the collection. However, there is a bug in the implementation that causes the method to throw an IllegalArgumentException instead of inserting the item.\n\nHere is the buggy method:\n\n```java\npublic class CollectionUtil {\n\n    public void addItem(Collection<?> collection, Object item, int position) {\n        if (position < 0 || position > collection.size()) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Position out of bounds\");\n        }\n        List<?> list = (List<?>) collection;\n        list.add(position, item);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTask: Identify the bug and provide the fully-qualified Java source class name that contains the bug.\n\n## Your task:In the provided Java code snippet, identify the bug and provide the fully-qualified Java source class name that contains the bug.

A Java method named 'findMaximum' is designed to find the maximum value in a collection of integers. The method takes a collection of integers as an argument and returns the maximum value found in the collection. If the collection is empty, the method should return -1. However, there is a bug in the implementation that causes incorrect behavior.\n\nHere is the buggy method:\n\n```java\npublic class MathUtil {"
