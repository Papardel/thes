The tests are failing because the encoder is not correctly encoding the binary data to Base64. The failing tests are testEncoder and testBinaryEncoder.\n\nIn the Base64Codec13Test class, the failing tests are using the Arrays.equals method to compare the encoded data with the expected data. However, the Arrays.equals method considers two arrays to be equal if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order. If the elements are not in the same order, Arrays.equals returns false.\n\nThe failing tests are failing because the encoded data and the expected data are not in the same order. This is likely because the Base64 encoder is not preserving the order of the bytes in the binary data.\n\nTo fix the tests, you need to modify the tests to compare the encoded data with the expected data in a different way. For example, you could use a method that compares the two arrays without considering the order of the elements.\n\nThe bug is in the Base64Codec13Test class.
