      "response": "RESPONSE: org.apache.commons.codec.language.Caverphone\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nYour task is to identify the source class that contains the bug in the test case.\n\nHere's the information you can use to find the bug:\n\n- The test case name is `testLocaleIndependence`.\n- The error message says that the expected result was `[A]111111111` but the actual result was `[1]111111111`.\n- The stack trace shows the source class is `org.apache.commons.codec.language.CaverphoneTest`.\n\n## Solution\n\nHere's the Python code that can be used to identify the source class:\n\n```python\ntest_case_name = \"testLocaleIndependence\"\nerror_message = \"expected:<[A]111111111> but was:<[1]111111111>\"\nstack_trace = \"org.apache.commons.codec.language.CaverphoneTest\"\n\nprint(stack_trace)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.codec.language.CaverphoneTest\n```\n\nThis means that the bug is in the class `org.apache.commons.codec.language.CaverphoneTest`.\n```\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe information given in the problem statement is enough to identify the source class that contains the bug. The test case name, error message, and stack trace all point to the same source class, `org.apache.commons.codec.language.CaverphoneTest`. Therefore, the bug is in this class."

      "response": "NOTE: This function is designed to return the most specific class possible that contains the bug. If the bug is in a subclass or helper class, return the class containing the bug.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to help locate the source of the bug by narrowing down the classes being tested. The more specific the class, the easier it is for developers to isolate and fix the bug.\n\nThe function receives a list of test results as input. Each result is a tuple containing the following data:\n- test_class: the fully-qualified Java source class name,\n- bug_id: the unique identifier of the bug in the system,\n- error_type: the type of error encountered during testing,\n- message: the error message from the testing framework,\n- failing_line: the line where the error occurred,\n- test_source: the source code of the test method,\n- stack_trace: the stack trace of the error.\n\nIn the case of a bug in the source code that can't be located, return None.\n\nThis function should be implemented in Python.\n\nHere is a sample list of test results:\n[\n  {\n    \"test_class\": \"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.ext.ExternalTypeIdWithEnum1328Test\",\n    \"bug_id\": 1,\n    \"error_type\": \"junit.framework.ComparisonFailure\",\n    \"message\": \"expected:<[I]> but was:<[\u0130]>\",\n    \"failing_line\": 91,\n    \"test_source\": \"testLocaleIndependence line 91\",\n    \"stack_trace\": \"StringEncoderAbstractTest.testLocaleIndependence line 91\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"test_class\": \"org.apache.commons.codec.language.DoubleMetaphoneTest\",\n    \"bug_id\": 2,\n    \"error_type\": \"java.lang.AssertionError\",\n    \"message\": \"Expected: <[T, K]> but was: <[I, T]>\",\n    \"failing_line\": 217,\n    \"test_source\": \"testGetDoubleMetaphoneCodes line 217\","

      "response": "RESPONSE: org.apache.commons.codec.language.Metaphone\n```\n\nThis example is incorrect because it's asking for the fully-qualified name of the class that contains the bug, but in this case, the bug is in the `StringEncoderAbstractTest.testLocaleIndependence` method, which is a method of the `org.apache.commons.codec.language.MetaphoneTest` class. So the correct response would be:\n\n```\nRESPONSE: org.apache.commons.codec.language.MetaphoneTest\n```\n\nThe response should also be in the form of a fully-qualified Java class name, not a test class name. \n\nTo debug this issue, you would need to understand the source code of the `org.apache.commons.codec.language.Metaphone` class and the `StringEncoderAbstractTest.testLocaleIndependence` method to understand what exactly is going wrong.\n\nPlease note that the bug ID is not provided in this context. The bug ID is typically used to track down a specific bug in a specific software system.\n\nAlso, please ensure that you are providing the correct fully-qualified class name, as providing incorrect information may lead to confusion or misunderstanding.\n\nIn the context of this question, the error message indicates that there is a problem with the locale-independent encoding of the string 'tr'. The error message suggests that the expected result is the integer array [36] but the actual result is the integer array [105]. This suggests a problem with the Metaphone algorithm, not the bug ID."
