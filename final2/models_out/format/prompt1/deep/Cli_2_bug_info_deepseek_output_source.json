The dataset used is from the California Housing dataset in the Kaggle Machine Learning Repository.\n\nThe project is divided into several tasks:\n\n1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:\n   - Load the data and perform initial analysis\n   - Handle missing values\n   - Encode categorical variables\n   - Split the dataset into training and testing datasets\n   \n2. Feature Engineering:\n   - Identify and create new features that could potentially improve model performance\n   - Perform feature scaling\n\n3. Model Selection:\n   - Choose an appropriate machine learning model for this problem\n   - Train the model on the training dataset\n   - Evaluate the model performance on the testing dataset\n   \n4. Model Evaluation:\n   - Perform hyperparameter tuning\n   - Evaluate the performance of the final model\n   \n5. Conclusion and Recommendations:\n   - Summarize the findings and the results\n   - Provide recommendations for further study and improvement\n\nTeam members:\n- Benedicta Lim\n- Harold Li\n- Amber Chen\n- Pengcheng Zhang\n- Jiaxi Yu\n- Mingjie Zhang\n\nTo run the code, you need to install the following libraries:\n- numpy\n- pandas\n- matplotlib\n- seaborn\n- scikit-learn\n- statsmodels\n\nIf you have these libraries installed, you should be able to run the code without any problems.\n\nIn addition, the data file \"housing.csv\" should be in the same directory as the Python code file for the code to run without errors.\n\nThe final report, which includes all the results and findings, is also included in this repository.\n\nPlease note that the code may take some time to run due to the size of the dataset.\n\nThanks for your attention"
