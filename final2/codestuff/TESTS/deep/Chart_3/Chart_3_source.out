### Failing Test
Test Source:
```java

  s1.add(new Year(2009), 100.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2010), 101.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2011), 102.0);
  assertEquals(100.0, s1.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(102.0, s1.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s2 = s1.createCopy(0, 1);
  assertEquals(100.0, s2.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

Analyse the failing test(s) above along with these candidate methods, these methods contain the causes of the test failures.
Your task is to identify the most likely lines of code in these methods that could cause the failure of the test cases above.
Look at the test cases, their stack traces, and the error messages to determine which lines in these methods are most likely responsible for the failure.
Return the signature of the method and the lines of code that are most likely responsible for the failure.

IMPORTANT: You must reply _exactly_ in this form:
RESPONSE:
<signature-1>: line of code

### Response:
The test cases are failing because the `createCopy` method is not found in the `TimeSeries` class. The `createCopy` method is expected to create a new `TimeSeries` object that is a copy of a portion of the original `TimeSeries` object.

Here is the signature of the method:

```java
public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end)
```

The method is expected to return a new `TimeSeries` object that contains a copy of the data from the original `TimeSeries` object, starting from the `start` index and ending at the `end` index.

The failure of the test cases could be due to several reasons:

1. The `createCopy` method is not implemented in the `TimeSeries` class.
2. The `createCopy` method is implemented but it does not work as expected.
3. The `createCopy` method is implemented correctly but it is not being called correctly.

The most likely lines of code in the `TimeSeries` class that could cause the failure of the test cases are:

```java
public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end) {
```

This line of code is the signature of the `createCopy` method. If this line is not present, the test cases will fail.
