### Instruction:
Test Class: org.jfree.data.time.junit.TimeSeriesTests
Method: testCreateCopy3
Error: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
Message: expected:<101.0> but was:<102.0>
Failing Line:         assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);
Test Source:
public void testCreateCopy3() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
  TimeSeries s1 = new TimeSeries("S1");
  s1.add(new Year(2009), 100.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2010), 101.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2011), 102.0);
  assertEquals(100.0, s1.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(102.0, s1.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s2 = s1.createCopy(0, 1);
  assertEquals(100.0, s2.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s3 = s1.createCopy(1, 2);

Identify the fully-qualified name of the non-test Java source classes that likely contain the bug causing the failure of the test cases above.
Analyze the test case sources, their stack traces, the error messages, and the failing lines to determine which classes are most likely responsible for the failure.
Pay attention to what class names are mentioned in the stack traces, error messages, and failing lines.

Return **only** the fully-qualified Java *source* class names.
Do **not** return:
- the test class itself (e.g. com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.ext.ExternalTypeIdWithEnum1328Test),
- any class whose simple name starts or ends with Test, Tests, ClassTest, TestUtils, or TestHelper,
- any test-utility class such as org.junit.Assert or org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.

### Response:
The error message indicates that the `getMaxY()` method of the `TimeSeries` class is not returning the expected value. This suggests that there might be a bug in the `getMaxY()` method.

Looking at the stack trace, it seems that the error is happening in the `testCreateCopy3` method of the `TimeSeriesTests` class. This suggests that the problem might be in the `createCopy` method of the `TimeSeries` class.

The `createCopy` method is expected to return a new `TimeSeries` object that is a copy of a subset of the original series. The `getMaxY` and `getMinY` methods are expected to return the maximum and minimum y-values of the subset of the series.

The failing line `assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);` suggests that the `getMaxY` method is not returning the expected value.

The only other class mentioned in the stack trace is `Year`, which is a part of the JFreeChart library. This suggests that the problem might be in the `Year` class or in the `TimeSeries` class.

Therefore, the most likely classes to be responsible for the failure are:

1. `org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries`
2. `org.jfree.data.time.Year`

Please note that these are potential classes, and the actual cause might be in a different class. You should thoroughly test these classes to find out the exact cause.
