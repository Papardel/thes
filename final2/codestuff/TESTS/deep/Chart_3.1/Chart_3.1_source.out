  assertEquals(100.0, s1.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(102.0, s1.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s2 = s1.createCopy(0, 1);

Analyse the failing test(s) above along with these candidate methods, these methods contain the causes of the test failures.
Your task is to identify the most likely lines of code in these methods that could cause the failure of the test cases above.
Look at the test cases, their stack traces, and the error messages to determine which lines in these methods are most likely responsible for the failure.
Return the signature of the method and the lines of code that are most likely responsible for the failure.

IMPORTANT: You must reply _exactly_ in this form:

### Response:
The test cases are failing because the `createCopy` method is not implemented in the `TimeSeries` class. The test cases are trying to call this method on an instance of `TimeSeries`, which is causing the `CloneNotSupportedException`.

The `getMinY` and `getMaxY` methods are returning the correct values, but the test cases are comparing these values to `100.0` and `102.0`, which are not the actual minimum and maximum values in the `TimeSeries`.

The `getDomainDescription` method is returning the correct domain description, but the test cases are not checking this.

The `add` method is correctly adding items to the `TimeSeries`, but the test cases are not checking this.

The `maxIgnoreNaN` method is correctly handling the case where one of the values is `NaN`, but the test cases are not checking this.

So, the most likely lines of code in the methods are:

```
TimeSeries.java:
public TimeSeries createCopy(int start, int end) {
        // Implementation of createCopy method
}
```

```
TimeSeries.java:
public double getMinY() {
        // Implementation of getMinY method
}
```

```
TimeSeries.java:
public String getDomainDescription() {
        // Implementation of getDomainDescription method
}
```

```
TimeSeries.java:
public void add(RegularTimePeriod period, double value, boolean notify) {
        // Implementation of add method
}
```

```
TimeSeries.java:
private double maxIgnoreNaN(double a, double b) {
        // Implementation of maxIgnoreNaN method
}
```
