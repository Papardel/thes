Identify the fully-qualified name of the non-test Java source classes that likely contain the bug causing the failure of the test cases above.
Analyze the test case sources, their stack traces, the error messages, and the failing lines to determine which classes are most likely responsible for the failure.
Pay attention to what class names are mentioned in the stack traces, error messages, and failing lines.

Return **only** the fully-qualified Java *source* class names.
Do **not** return:
- the test class itself (e.g. com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.jsontype.ext.ExternalTypeIdWithEnum1328Test),
- any class whose simple name starts or ends with Test, Tests, ClassTest, TestUtils, or TestHelper,
- any test-utility class such as org.junit.Assert or org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.

### Response:
The failing line in the test case is:

```java
assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);
```

This means that the `getMaxY()` method of the `s2` object is returning a value that is not equal to `101.0` within an acceptable error margin of `EPSILON`.

Looking at the test case, the `s2` object is created by calling `s1.createCopy(0, 1)`, which means it should contain the same data as `s1`, but starting from the second data point (index 1). Therefore, the `getMaxY()` method should return `101.0`, not `102.0`.

Therefore, the most likely source of the bug is in the `createCopy()` method of the `TimeSeries` class.

The fully-qualified class name of the source class is:

```java
org.jfree.data.time.TimeSeries
```
