### Failing Test
Test Source:
```java
public void testCreateCopy3() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
  TimeSeries s1 = new TimeSeries("S1");
  s1.add(new Year(2009), 100.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2010), 101.0);
  s1.add(new Year(2011), 102.0);
  assertEquals(100.0, s1.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(102.0, s1.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s2 = s1.createCopy(0, 1);
  assertEquals(100.0, s2.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(101.0, s2.getMaxY(), EPSILON);

  TimeSeries s3 = s1.createCopy(1, 2);
  assertEquals(101.0, s3.getMinY(), EPSILON);
  assertEquals(102.0, s3.getMaxY(), EPSILON);
  }

Analyse the failing test(s) above along with these candidate methods, these methods contain the causes of the test failures.
Your task is to identify the most likely lines of code in these methods that could cause the failure of the test cases above.
Look at the test cases, their stack traces, and the error messages to determine which lines in these methods are most likely responsible for the failure.
Return the signature of the method and the lines of code that are most likely responsible for the failure.

IMPORTANT: You must reply _exactly_ in this form:
RESPONSE:
<signature-1>: line of code
 line of code
<signature-2>: line of code
 line of code
<signature-3>: line of code
 line of code
